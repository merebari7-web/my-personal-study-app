/* v10.0 — THE TEACHING SUITE (edu.js)
   A deferred feature module for My Personal Study App.
   It adds the tools a Nigerian SS1–SS3 teacher and every Senior Secondary
   candidate actually use in class:
     📚 Lesson Notes    — term-organized, objectives + content + key points +
                          worked examples + class evaluation, per SS1/SS2/SS3
     💻 CBT Centre      — a real computer-based test (instructions, candidate
                          form, answer sheet, timer, submit, review + result slip)
     🗓 Scheme of Work  — 1st/2nd/3rd term weekly topic outline, all 13 subjects
     🧭 Syllabus Map    — the 13-subject SS1–SS3 syllabus, class by class
     🏅 Marking Guide   — WAEC/NECO grade scale + quick marking tips

   Everything runs on the device and reuses the app's own question bank, so it
   can never drift from the syllabus content that is already verified in bank.js.

/* v11.0 — EXTENDED CURRICULUM SUBJECTS
   Six more Nigerian SS1–SS3 subjects, delivered through the existing Teaching
   Suite lesson-note engine (topics -> keywords -> key facts -> questions).
   Each topic: [name, keywords[], keyFactsString, questions[{q,o,a,e}]].
   Questions are authored against the WAEC/NECO syllabus; the suite renders
   the first two as worked examples and the rest as class evaluation. */
